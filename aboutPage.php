        <p>This is an open-source video sharing platform where you can upload any video that you choose. 
           You can also like, dislike, comment on videos, and subscribe to the creator of the video.
           This website functions similarily to YouTube, so hopefully all of the functionality feels intuitive.
           <br><br>
           Get started by creating an account by clicking the "Sign In" button on the top right, or by clicking the menu icon on the top right and then clicking "Sign In". You can then interact with videos more than without an account, by liking, dislking, commenting, and subscribing to the creator of the video. For more details on how to use andromeda, click here.
